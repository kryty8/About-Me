### Hello Everyone! 

My name is Krzysztof but you can call me Krzysiek or Kris 😎

I am currently a student at the Poznan School of Banking, my field of study is Computer Science with a specialization profile: Advanced Database Systems

I graduated from the Poznan University of Technology with a degree in Electronics and Telecommunications. The engineering thesis was done with a colleague Wojciech (https://github.com/Wojciech00Pal), it has the title: 'Communication in IoT systems'.

A little words bit about me:

~ I like video games 🎮, some strategy like CiV V (my favorite!), First Person Shooter (for example The Halo Series) or more Multiplayer like Overwatch <br />
~ I like also board games 🎲, like Cavern Tavern <br />
~ I like to play chess and watching tournaments about them ♟️ <br />
~ I like to take photos 📷 <br />
~ I am here to enhance to learn new topics 💡 
~ I like computers and programing, still lerning about them 

In this profile i'll add my projects, to show what i did.
